In this program, I demonstrated the ability to gather data from an API and develop a front-end interface that displays the data. Used Angular to create a webpage that communicates with a backend server written in Node.js/Express to browse the music on Spotify, a popular music streaming app. The backend server will handle authentication via OAuth and communicate with the Spotify API, made HTTP requests to the backend server to trigger API calls. The page will support searching for artists, albums, and tracks and navigating between the three resources.
